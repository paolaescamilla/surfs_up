# Oahu weather analysis

## Overview 
The purpose of the analysis is to provide stakeholders with detailed information about the weather forecast in Oahu island to support the decision making process for the opening of an ice cream shop for the surfer population. 

For this analysis, the temperature data of the months of June and December is analyzed using statistical methods in order to retrieve an overview of how weather behaves during these two months. 

## Results

- The month of December records the lowest minimum temperature than June. However, the difference between both minimum temperatures is of only eight degrees meaning that both months can potentially be equally cold.
- The count in the month of June is notoriously higher than for December. The reason can potentially be that the month of June presents a higher variation in temperatures while December shows a less likeliness to sudden changes between cold and warm.
- The 25%, 50% and 75% for the month of June present a well shaped bell curve while the one for the month of December is more skewed to the right. This reflects that the temperatures in June follow a more stable pattern (start low, then increase, to then low again) while in December it seems that the temperature is propense to gradually decrease.

## Summary
To sum up, the month of June and December hold a record of very similar temperatures with a very minimun difference between the coldest and warmest temperatures. 

However, the month of June shows a more stable pattern between cold and warm temperatures even though temperatures can report a high variation. For December, temperatures are less likely to sudden changes between cold and warm however there is a less stable pattern for the transition between warm and cold.
